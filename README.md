# DSLR

`DSLR` is a machine learning project focused on implementing a simple **Data Science Logistic Regression** model in Python. The goal of this project is to build a classifier that predicts categories based on input data using logistic regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and aims to provide hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## About the Project

The `DSLR` project focuses on implementing logistic regression from scratch without using high-level libraries like scikit-learn. This project will help deepen your understanding of machine learning concepts such as data normalization, gradient descent, cost function minimization, and model evaluation metrics.

## Features

- Implementation of logistic regression from scratch in Python
- Data preprocessing including normalization and handling missing values
- Training and evaluation of the logistic regression model
- Visualization of data and model performance
- Interpretation of model parameters and prediction results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12** or later
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
